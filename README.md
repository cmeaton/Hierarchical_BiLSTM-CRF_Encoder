# Hierarchical_BiLSTM-CRF_Encoder

This repository is an attempt to debug and make functional the existing code base from [this](https://github.com/YanWenqiang/HBLSTM-CRF/blob/master/HBLSTM-CRF.py) repo. The code is an implementation of a paper titlted [Dialogue Act Recognition via CRF-Attentive Structured Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05568.pdf). The paper claims a nearly SOTA solution to Dialogue Act classification from text sequences. 

To run the code, clone the repository and run `python model.py`. This will train your model on the Switchboard Dialogue Act dataset referenced in the paper.

The Switchboard Dialogue Act data has been taken from the following [repo](https://github.com/cgpotts/swda). The repo provides the raw data as well as a preprocessing script to make the data more usable. I have already done this and am including the processed data.

You will notice another file in this repository, `processed_data.py`. I wrote this because the model requires the data to be further processed in order to be fed into its architecture. This is automatically called in `model.py`.

For the project, I have used:
- Python 3
- tensorflow == 1.15.0
- pandas == 0.25.3
- numpy == 1.17.5

### NOTE:

_January 23, 2020_
- This code still has bugs. The model trains but consistently breaks on the second validation scoring loop in `model.py`.
